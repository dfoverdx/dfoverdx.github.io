        Fail plans on streaming for 12 hours next <b>Sunday, October 14th</b>! He would like chat's input on which

                        If I (dx_over_dt) and/or other developers in chat have time before Sunday, it might be a

                        If not (and this is the more likely case), it will involve some random picks that are

                        just because I <i>happen</i> to get picked for every game, there's no way to prove that it

                                    This guideline doesn't necessarily mean he won't play games that he can't beat

                                    It's also <i>possible</i> he may do this again (this is a bit of a test run),
                                    and your 20-hour game (that, let's be honest, would take Fail 36 hours to beat) may
                                    be picked back up in later streams.

                                Fail plays a lot of Mario and Zelda hacks and will continue to do so, so for
                                single-player games try to pick games he likely wouldn't play otherwise.

                                Fail's not rich, so for games he's not likely to already own (or can't find a

                                legal ROM for), AAA/expensive titles may have a harder time getting selected.

                                For multiplayer games, choose games that lots of viewers are likely to have and
                                which either have <b>very short matches</b> (e.g. Super Smash Bros) or <b>support lots of
                                players at once</b> so lots of us can join in the fun.

                                This should go without saying, but nothing that would violate Twitch's TOS. We may
